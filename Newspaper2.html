                Chinese journalist Li Zehua, who formerly worked for state broadcaster CCTV and goes by the name Kcriss
                Li, was held by authorities for reporting on the COVID-19 outbreak from Wuhan in early 2020. In a new
                interview with CPJ’s China correspondent Iris Hsu and Director of Special Projects Robert Mahoney, Li
                said that he wishes he had done more.</p>

                <p>It was this, as much as anything, that gave people courage, and I suppose the new arrivals from
                    Woking also helped to restore confidence. At any rate, as the dusk came on a slow, intermittent
                    movement upon the sand pits began, a movement that seemed to gather force as the stillness of the
                    evening about the cylinder remained unbroken. Vertical black figures in twos and threes would
                    advance, stop, watch, and advance again, spreading out as they did so in a thin irregular crescent
                    that promised to enclose the pit in its attenuated horns. I, too, on my side began to move towards
                    the pit.</p>

                <p>Then I saw some cabmen and others had walked boldly into the sand pits, and heard the clatter of
                    hoofs and the gride of wheels. I saw a lad trundling off the barrow of apples. And then, within
                    thirty yards of the pit, advancing from the direction of Horsell, I noted a little black knot of
                    men, the foremost of whom was waving a white flag.</p>

                    meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray
                    gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling
                    stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear
                    the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable
                    forms of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own

                <p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed
                    into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could
                    see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was
                    hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. </p>

                <p>His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he
                    looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room
                    although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile
                    samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a
                    picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame.
                    It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff
                    that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the
                    window at the dull weather. </p>
